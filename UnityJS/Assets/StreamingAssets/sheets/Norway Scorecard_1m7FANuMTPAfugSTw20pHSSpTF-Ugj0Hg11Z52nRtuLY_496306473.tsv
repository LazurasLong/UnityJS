	Payne assumes the team is strong (125% comparison) with a huge market opportunity (150% comparison). However, the startup is playing in a highly competitive environment (75%). By multiplying the sum factor (1.0750) by the average pre-money valuation ($1.5M) we arrive with a pre-money valuation of roughly $1.6M for the target startup.
